# VictoriaTransitTracker

As of April 2019 Victoria has yet to release their real time bus tracking officially.  Despite this, the GTFS data is available online.
Since im tired of waiting to see where my bus is I wrote this.


## Requirements

pip install flask
pip install gtfs-realtime-bindings
pip install folium
